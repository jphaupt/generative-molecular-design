# Generative Molecular Design


## TODOs

- [ ] Flesh out readme
- [ ] [General notes](notes.md)
- [ ] Test model on smaller dataset, e.g. 3000
- [ ] use fact that bonding is symmetric? - or perhaps useful to keep as is, e.g. might give insights like "oxygen lends more electrons", or could be a useful consistency check
- [ ] Thorough unit test suite
  - [ ] Train on a single sample and check for reconstruction (basic functionality of *overfitting*)
